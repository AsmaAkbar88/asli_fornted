# Module 1: ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. This module introduces you to ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), which serves as the foundation for communication and coordination in robotic systems.

ROS 2 is a flexible framework for writing robot software that provides a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions to simplify the development of complex robotic applications. It addresses the challenges of distributed computing, hardware abstraction, device drivers, and communication between different parts of a robot system.

In this module, we'll cover the fundamentals of ROS 2, including its architecture, core concepts, and practical implementation for humanoid robotics applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the core concepts and architecture of ROS 2
- Create and manage ROS 2 packages, nodes, topics, and services
- Implement communication patterns for robotic applications
- Apply ROS 2 concepts to humanoid robotics scenarios

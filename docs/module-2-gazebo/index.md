# Module 2: Gazebo/Unity (Simulation Environments)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. This module covers simulation environments, focusing primarily on Gazebo as a robotics simulation platform, with additional insights into Unity for advanced simulation scenarios.

Simulation environments are critical for developing, testing, and validating robotic systems before deploying to real hardware. They allow for safe experimentation, rapid prototyping, and the generation of synthetic data for training AI models. Gazebo has become the standard simulation environment for ROS-based robotics development, while Unity provides advanced graphics and physics capabilities for more complex scenarios.

In this module, we'll cover the fundamentals of simulation in robotics, including how to create realistic environments, model robots and objects, configure physics properties, and integrate simulation with real-world robotics workflows.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the role of simulation in robotics development
- Create and configure simulation environments in Gazebo
- Model robots, objects, and environments for simulation
- Configure physics properties and sensors in simulation
- Integrate simulation with ROS 2 for hardware-in-the-loop testing
- Understand when to use Unity for advanced simulation scenarios
